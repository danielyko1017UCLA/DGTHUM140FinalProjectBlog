    "text": "Description\nThis analysis aims to look for patterns and/or correlations between labor status in the US (eg. employed, unemployed) and other factors such as ethnicity (eg. White, Black/African-American) and gender (male or female). These will be compared against each other to provide different insights into what may be related with each other. More specifically, the differences between different factors and categories will be explored. The primary libraries that will be used are pandas and matplotlib, although other libraries such as requests and BeautifulSoup were used to help with scraping the data."

    "text": "Motivation\nThe primary motivation for analyzing this data is to see if there are any noticeable differences between groups of people when it comes to labor in the US. Employment (or rather, unemployment) is a very important part of people’s lives, and discovering if there are clear biases in “intrinsic factors” will make it easier to figure out why these biases exist. In other words, using objective analysis can make it easier for proper political discussion to lead the right direction and for the general public to understand what employment trends are."
